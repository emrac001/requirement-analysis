# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting the process of **Requirement Analysis**, a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  

The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured blueprint of how requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented for a software system.  

As part of this project, I will define:
- **Functional and Non-functional Requirements**  
- **User Stories**  
- **Use Case Diagrams**  
- **Acceptance Criteria**  

The case study for this repository is a **Booking Management System**.  
This simulation mirrors real-world software development practices, ensuring clarity, structure, and alignment with stakeholder needs.
