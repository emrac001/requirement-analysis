# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

## Introduction
This repository is dedicated to documenting the process of **Requirement Analysis**, a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC).  

The purpose of this repository is to provide a structured blueprint of how requirements are gathered, analyzed, and documented for a software system.  

As part of this project, I will define:
- **Functional and Non-functional Requirements**  
- **User Stories**  
- **Use Case Diagrams**  
- **Acceptance Criteria**  

The case study for this repository is a **Booking Management System**.  
This simulation mirrors real-world software development practices, ensuring clarity, structure, and alignment with stakeholder needs.

## What is Requirement Analysis?

**Requirement Analysis** is a critical phase in the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) where the needs and expectations of stakeholders are gathered, examined, and documented. The main purpose is to ensure a clear understanding of what the system should do and how it should perform before actual development begins.  

### Importance of Requirement Analysis in SDLC
- **Clarity and Understanding**: Ensures that stakeholders and the development team share the same vision of the software system.  
- **Scope Definition**: Clearly defines what is included (and excluded) in the project, reducing the risk of scope creep.  
- **Foundation for Design & Development**: Provides the baseline for system architecture, design, and coding.  
- **Accurate Estimation**: Helps in estimating time, cost, and resources required for successful delivery.  
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures the final product aligns with user expectations and business goals, improving overall satisfaction.  

Without proper requirement analysis, projects risk miscommunication, rework, budget overruns, and failure to meet user needs. It sets the stage for building reliable, efficient, and user-focused software systems.

## Why is Requirement Analysis Important?

Requirement Analysis is one of the most crucial phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). It ensures that the software product being developed aligns with business goals, user needs, and technical feasibility. Some key reasons why it is important include:

1. **Clarity and Mutual Understanding**  
   Requirement analysis eliminates ambiguity by making sure all stakeholders (clients, users, and developers) share the same vision of what the system should do. This avoids costly misunderstandings later in the project.  

2. **Defining Project Scope**  
   It establishes the boundaries of the project by clearly outlining what features will be included. This helps prevent scope creep, ensuring the project remains focused and manageable.  

3. **Foundation for Design and Development**  
   The gathered requirements serve as a blueprint for system architecture and design. Development teams rely on these specifications to build a system that meets stakeholder expectations.  

4. **Accurate Estimation of Cost, Time, and Resources**  
   A clear set of requirements enables project managers to estimate the budget, timeline, and workforce needed more precisely, reducing the risks of overruns.  

5. **Quality Assurance and Customer Satisfaction**  
   By validating requirements early, the final product is more likely to meet user expectations and business needs, resulting in higher quality and satisfied stakeholders.
